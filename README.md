# Dog Breed Identifier

Have you ever seen a picture of a dog and wondered what breed it was?

Our project will focus on building a model that can accurately predict a dog's breed based on an uploaded image.

Data will be sources from Kaggle as well as potentially Google.

## Process Questions:

What features can we key in on to identify breeds?

How many breeds can we reasonably identify?

Are there other models we can build upon?

What is the best framework to use? (Tensorflow, Keras, etc.)

What is the best way to break down our data into testing and training?

## Further Questions:

Can we expand to other animals?

Can we predict other dog features? (Relative height, weight, age, etc.) - Our guess is not accurately, but it's still a thought.
